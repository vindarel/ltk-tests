A noob trying out Tk GUIs in Common Lisp.

Nothing fancy, private tests, hopefully helping someone to getting
started, until they make it to a proper tutorial.

How to create widgets: `(make-instance 'widget-name)`, for example

~~~lisp
(make-instance 'frame)
(make-instance 'treeview)
~~~

How to place them on the grid:

~~~lisp
;; (grid <widget> <column> <row> &options)
(grid c 0 0 :sticky "n" ;; north
            :padx 5 :pady 5)
~~~

The rest is discoverable !

~~~lisp
(make-instance 'treeview)
;; and
(treeview-insert c.tree :text "some text"))
